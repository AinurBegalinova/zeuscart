        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <p><b>Welcome to ZeusCart 2.3</b>, the most feature rich, flexible and cost effective way to build
an on-line store.</p>
        <p>ZeusCart 2.3 is a unique e-commerce web site construction tool. Designed for business
people with little or no technical skills, it constructs even the most complex stores quickly
and easily. It has built in integration for secure multi-currency pricing and
payment gateway, as well as many other features required by businesses who wish to
trade via the Internet, such as stock control, order processing, tax, shipping, discounting,
key event emailing and reporting. It enables you to offer many thousands of products in a
store and has the facilities for you to change the look and feel of your store to suit your
individual or corporate needs.</p>
        <p>Store building and administration can be done on-line using a standard Internet connection and a web browser. No other software needs to be installed on your
workstation unless you wish to use the Off-line Inventory Builder tool.Tax and shipping has also been designed with cross border trading in mind.</p>
        <p>An electronic store comprises two parts - a client side (the storefront) and an administrator side (Administrator Console).</p>
        <p>The client side (the storefront) is your website as seen by visitors. The ZeusCart 2.3's client side allows the visitors to your site to browse products in the online store, select products and put them into the shopping cart, as in a conventional supermarket, and then pay for the selected products using a credit card or other payment options.</p>
        <p>The ZeusCart 2.3's administrator side allows you to stock up the store with products, as a conventional warehouse, maintain the inventory, track orders and payments.</p>
        <p>This guide will take you through all the stages required to construct a ZeusCart 2.3 store,
so before you continue, finish reading this introductory chapter as the information
contained here will introduce you to some important considerations concerning trading
on-line, and as such will have a bearing on the text you enter, the choices you make and
the way that you build your store.</p>
